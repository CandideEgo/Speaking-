"""Behavior collection service — ingest user interaction events (ADR-0011 P0).

Writes to the behavior_events table AND mirrors side-effects onto
LearningRecord (time_spent_seconds, completed) and Video.view_count. This
dual-write closes the long-standing LearningRecord gap — previously
time_spent_seconds / completed had no write path at all (position /
progress_percentage go through the existing /learning/progress endpoint,
which the frontend now calls for resume + periodic position saves).

Not a recommendation engine — just the data channel. Ranking/scoring live in
