"""Shared infrastructure for the video processing pipeline.

Provides the "lock + step recovery + error commit" skeleton that all three
pipeline tasks (process_video, finalize_video, localize_video) previously
duplicated.  Each task now declares its steps and delegates the plumbing
here — including the step loop itself (``run_steps``), so that "in which
order", "which steps exist" and "what each may take" are one declaration
instead of a declaration plus a hand-written if-sequence.

Design goals (deep-module philosophy):
- **Leverage**: callers get lock/step/error semantics from a single import.
- **Locality**: the "what happens on failure" contract lives in one place.
- **Testability**: ``commit_error_state`` is a single seam for testing
  "any step throws → DB state is consistent".

    """One pipeline step: resume name, progress percent, watchdog budget, body.

    **Order in ``STEPS`` is the pipeline order** (extracting → … → done). The
    two maps below are views of this tuple, so "what steps exist", "in which
    order" and "what each is allowed to take" cannot drift apart — previously
    the order lived only in ``finalize_video``'s if-sequence, a hundred lines
    away from the two maps that had to agree with it.

    ``timeout_attr`` names the ``Settings`` field holding the budget in
    seconds; ``None`` means "no budget" (the terminal step). It is a name and
    not a value because the watchdog reads settings at call time — an admin
    setting is re-read per run, a module-level constant would freeze it.

    ``run`` is the body. The canonical tuple here leaves it ``None``: bodies
    live with the task that owns them (the tail's bodies call
    ``video_processing``'s helpers), and the task attaches them by name via
    ``dataclasses.replace`` — so the order stays declared here while the code
    stays where its collaborators are.

    ``skip_run`` is for the rare step that still owes something to *later*
    steps when a resume skips it: ``downloading`` must re-derive the local file
    path for ``transcoding`` even when the download already happened.

    ``resumable=False`` marks the terminal step. It is never consulted against
    the completed-step set (there is nothing after it to resume into) and it is
    not stamped as the failure attribution — a failure there belongs to the
    last step that actually did work.
