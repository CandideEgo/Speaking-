"""Standard Version registry — one canonical video per source_url.

A "standard version" is the shared baseline for a ``source_url``: the first
video to reach ``ready`` for that URL becomes its standard, and all subsequent
submissions fork from it (copying subtitles + practice + metadata) instead of
re-running the GPU pipeline. See docs/plans/PIPELINE-RESUME-DEDUP-AUDIT.md
Phase 2 and ADR-0006.

``source_url`` is the PK → the DB enforces "one URL, one standard" and
prevents concurrent finalize races from creating two standards. Replacing a
standard (Grilling 决议 7) is an atomic repoint of ``canonical_video_id``;
the old standard video demotes to a plain Video (its media kept if forks
exist). The standard is a *role*, not an intrinsic property of a Video row,
which is why it lives in a separate table rather than a flag on ``videos``.
