"""Pipeline task outbox — durable "this task must run" intent (A05/BE-01).

The pipeline used to commit its DB state and then call ``.delay()``. Those are
two systems, so the window between them loses work: a broker hiccup or a crash
right after the commit leaves the video stranded. Re-calling the callback does
not help — the status guard acknowledges it as a duplicate — and the watchdog
only marks the video failed.

This table closes that window: the intent is written in the **same
transaction** as the state change, a best-effort inline attempt follows the
commit, and ``dispatch_pipeline_tasks`` (beat) re-sends anything still
pending. Delivery is at-least-once; both pipeline tasks are idempotent under
the Redis processing lock and the completed-step set, so a duplicate send is
harmless.

Rows are kept after dispatch for auditing (attempts, last error) and pruned by
the same beat task after the retention window.
