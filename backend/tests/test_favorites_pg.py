"""Postgres integration tests for the note-write races (H3).

The default suite runs on in-memory SQLite, where ``with_for_update`` is
silently ignored (see ``tests/conftest.py``), so it cannot express whether two
concurrent note writes serialize. Against a real Postgres, two parallel PUTs
from the same user previously both saw "no note", both INSERTed, and the second
one failed with the uncaught ``IntegrityError`` from
``uq_user_note_user_video`` — a 500 that also threw the note away. Two parallel
DELETEs both loaded the same row, so the loser's DELETE matched zero rows
(SQLAlchemy's rowcount check flags it; a versioned mapper would raise
``StaleDataError``). And a DELETE racing a PUT used to break the PUT: its
UPDATE matched the row the DELETE had just removed —
``StaleDataError: UPDATE statement on table 'user_notes' expected to update
1 row(s); 0 were matched`` — the 500 that put the video row lock in
``delete_note``.

Marked ``integration`` (see pytest.ini). Locally:

    PG_TEST_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://seeword:seeword_dev@localhost:5432/<clean-db> \\
        pytest tests/test_favorites_pg.py -v

The target database must be a dedicated/clean one: the integration branch of
conftest drops and recreates every table. CI's backend job points
``DATABASE_URL`` at its Postgres service, so these run there too; without a
reachable Postgres they skip loudly.
