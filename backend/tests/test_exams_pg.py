"""Postgres integration tests for exam submission atomicity (A06 / BE-03).

The default suite runs on in-memory SQLite, where every request in a test shares
one database file and the interleavings that broke submission cannot be staged.
The defect was a read-then-write on ``exam_sessions.submitted_at``: two requests
each loaded the attempt while it was still unsubmitted, both graded, and a
three-question paper ended up with six answer rows plus two ``practiced_items``
LearningEvents.

The fix makes the write decide: ``exam_service._claim_submit`` runs a conditional
``UPDATE … WHERE submitted_at IS NULL``, and the losing request replays the
winner's settled result. On PostgreSQL the loser blocks on the row lock until
the winner commits and then re-evaluates the predicate against the committed row,
which is what these tests exercise — SQLite would serialise the whole thing and
prove nothing about the lock.

Locally (needs a dedicated, throwaway database — the fixture drops every table):

    PG_TEST_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://seeword:seeword_dev@localhost:5432/<clean-db> \\
        pytest tests/test_exams_pg.py -v

CI's backend job points ``DATABASE_URL`` at its Postgres service, so these run
there too; without a reachable Postgres they skip loudly.
