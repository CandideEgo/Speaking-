"""Postgres integration tests for the concurrent-promote races (catalog).

The default suite runs on in-memory SQLite, where ``with_for_update`` is
silently ignored (see ``tests/conftest.py``), so it cannot express whether two
concurrent promotes of the same catalog item serialize. Against a real
Postgres, two parallel POSTs used to both read the item before either had
written ``promoted_video_id``, both called ``seed_video``, and the URL ended up
with two ``Video`` rows and two GPU runs.

Two ``seed_video`` stubs, because the concurrency has two regimes:

* :func:`test_concurrent_promote_seeds_once_and_creates_one_video` uses a stub
  that does **not** write through the request's session. That isolates the row
  lock: the loser's ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` blocks until the winner commits,
  then re-reads the row (READ COMMITTED re-evaluation) and reuses the winner's
  video. Drop ``with_for_update()`` from ``catalog_service.get_item`` and it
  fails with two awaited seeds.
* :func:`test_concurrent_first_promote_seeds_once_with_committing_seed` uses a
  stub shaped like the real ``seed_video``: it inserts a ``Video`` and commits.
  That commit releases the item row lock at the very moment its video becomes
  visible to other transactions, so for a *first-ever* promote the lock alone
  cannot help — the loser reads ``promoted_video_id IS NULL``. What closes that
  window is ``promote_item``'s URL-scoped reuse lookup, which finds the
  freshly committed official video for the item's ``source_url``. This test is
  the regression guard for that lookup.

Marked ``integration`` (see pytest.ini). Locally:

    PG_TEST_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://seeword:seeword_dev@localhost:5432/speaking_test \\
        pytest tests/test_catalog_pg.py -v

The target database must be a dedicated/clean one: the integration branch of
conftest drops and recreates every table. CI's backend job points
``DATABASE_URL`` at its Postgres service, so these run there too; without a
reachable Postgres they skip loudly.
