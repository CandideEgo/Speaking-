"""GPU transcription task + cloud callback delivery.

Moved out of ``backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py`` (the GPU segment of the
head / GPU / tail split) with the logic unchanged. What differs is only the
import surface: settings/logging/source-enum/cookies now come from
``gpu_worker.*`` instead of ``app.*``, and there is no database, no OSS and no
pipeline state here by design.

The task runs on the desktop GPU machine, consumes the ``transcription_gpu``
queue, transcribes with WhisperX (faster-whisper fallback) and POSTs the
subtitles back to the cloud callback endpoint. Its only output channel is that
HTTP callback.
